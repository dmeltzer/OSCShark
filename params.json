It's written in C++ and QT. It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.\r\n\r\n#### [Downloads](#releases)\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://raw.github.com/hypebeast/OSCShark/master/assets/screenshots/screenshot_1.png)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nOSC Shark provides the following features:\r\n\r\n* Cross-Platform (Windows, Linux and Mac OS)\r\n* No external dependencies\r\n* Listening for incoming OSC messages on multiple ports\r\n* Enable/Disable specific listening ports\r\n* OSC Address filtering\r\n* Timestamps for incoming OSC messages\r\n* Log only OSC messages from updated OSC addresses\r\n* Export logged OSC messages to a CSV file\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nOSC Shark is written in C++ and QT. It should run on every major platform: Windows, Linux and Mac OS.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install OSC Shark is to download one of the prebuild packages.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Currently prebuild packages are only available for Mac OS. Packages for Windows and Linux will be provided in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you want to build OSC Shark by yourself see the 'For Developer' chapter for further instructions.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe usage is quite simple:\r\n\r\n1. Start OSC Shark\r\n2. Add one or more listening ports with the **Add Port** button\r\n3. Start listening on a port with a double click\r\n\r\n## Releases\r\n\r\n### 0.0.1\r\n\r\nInitial release.\r\n\r\n**Downloads**\r\n\r\n* Mac OS: [OSCShark v0.0.1.dmg](http://sebastianruml.com/downloads/projects/OSCShark/OSCShark%20v0.0.1.dmg)\r\n\r\n## For Developers\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* QT >= 5.1.1 (every QT 5 release should work too)\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\nBrief guide:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/hypebeast/OSCShark.git\r\n    $ cd OSCShark\r\n    $ qmake OSCShark.pro\r\n    $ make\r\n\r\nNow you should find an executable your build directory.\r\n\r\n### Generate a DMG Image on Mac OS\r\n\r\nThere is a script for building a DMG image that can be distributed to end-users. In order to build the DMG image you need to execute the following commands:\r\n\r\n    $ cd OSCShark\r\n    $ qmake\r\n    $ cd scripts\r\n    $ ./pack_installer_mac.sh\r\n\r\nOnce the script is finished, you should find the DMG image in the *scripts* directory.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to [Kasper Kamperman](http://www.kasperkamperman.com/) for the initial idea. You can find his OSC Datamonitor [here](http://www.kasperkamperman.com/blog/osc-datamonitor/).\r\n\r\nFor receiving OSC messages [OscPkt](http://gruntthepeon.free.fr/oscpkt/) is used.
